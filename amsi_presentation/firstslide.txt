This talk concerns fluid flow, such as the example here, called the double gyre flow
THese are particles being pushed around by the flow, and although there is a lot of chaotic mixing going on here,
we can distinguish some structure.

We are interested in ways in which you can extract this structure mathematically, which is what the area of Lagrangian coherent 
structures is all about.







FTLE and LAVD are small scale structure
Temperature gave large scale structure and 
combination gave both when combined
